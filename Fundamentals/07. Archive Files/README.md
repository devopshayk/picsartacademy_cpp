# Object Files (.o) and Static Libraries (.a) — A Cohesive Guide

This document explains what object files and static libraries are, why they exist, and how they are used together in C/C++ build systems. Where helpful, it introduces the ELF format (sections and headers) and the essentials of linking, symbol resolution, and relocation. The goal is clarity and a single coherent narrative.

---

## 1. Object Files (.o)

### What is an object file?
An object file is the output of compiling a single source file (`.c`/`.cpp`) without linking. It contains machine code plus metadata needed for later stages.

### Why object files?
- Enable incremental builds: only changed sources recompile
- Support modular design: separate compilation per translation unit
- Provide metadata: symbols, relocations, and section layout for the linker

### How object files are used
- They are inputs to the linker. The linker combines multiple `.o` files (and optionally libraries) into an executable or a shared library.

---

## 2. Static Libraries (.a)

### What is a static library?
A static library is an archive (`.a`) of many object files. Think of it as a container bundling `.o` files along with a symbol index to make lookup fast.

### Why static libraries?
- Reuse: package related functionality behind a stable API
- Faster links: one library instead of many separate `.o` paths
- Distribution: share compiled code without exposing sources

### How static libraries are used
- During linking, the linker scans the library and extracts only the object files required to resolve currently undefined symbols in the link.
- Linking order matters: libraries should appear after the objects that reference them.

## 3. ELF Essentials (just enough to understand .o and .a)

Most Unix-like systems use ELF (Executable and Linkable Format). You rarely need all details; these are the parts that matter for `.o` and `.a`:

### Sections you will see
- `.text`: machine code for functions
- `.rodata`: read-only data (string literals, constants)
- `.data`: initialized writable globals
- `.bss`: zero-initialized globals (occupies no space on disk)
- `.symtab` + `.strtab`: symbols and their names (for the linker/tools)
- `.rel.*` / `.rela.*`: relocation entries describing how to fix up addresses

### Files and headers
- Relocatable object (`.o`): has an ELF header and a section header table (no program headers because it’s not runnable)
- Static library (`.a`): is not ELF itself; it’s an ar-archive containing multiple ELF `.o` members plus a symbol index
- Executable/shared object: adds program headers that guide the loader at runtime (not present in `.o`)

---

## 4. Linking — putting the pieces together

### The linker’s job
- Combine sections from multiple `.o` files
- Resolve undefined symbols (find their definitions)
- Apply relocations (fix addresses)
- Produce a final image (executable or shared object)

### Library participation
- When the linker encounters an undefined symbol, it searches libraries listed on the command line (in order). If a library contains an object file that defines the symbol, that object file is pulled in and its references are processed.
- Only needed members of a static library are extracted, keeping the final output lean.

### Order matters
- Place dependent objects first, then libraries that satisfy them. Example pattern: `gcc obj1.o obj2.o -L<path> -l<name> -o app`.

## 5. Symbols and Resolution

### Symbol basics
- A symbol is a named entity (typically a function or global) appearing in the symbol table
- Binding types include `LOCAL`, `GLOBAL`, and `WEAK`
- Undefined symbols (section `UND`) must be resolved from other objects or libraries during the link

### Common symbol categories
- Function symbols (`FUNC`) — implementations in `.text`
- Object symbols (`OBJECT`) — data in `.data`/`.bss`
- Undefined symbols — declared/used but not defined in the current object

### Practical implications
- Mismatched declarations cause link errors or undefined behavior
- Multiple strong definitions of the same symbol cause “multiple definition” errors
- Weak symbols act as fallbacks if a strong definition is not provided

---

## 6. Relocations — why they exist

### What is relocation?
Object files cannot know final addresses at compile time. Relocation entries record “fixups” that the linker must apply when it lays out sections in memory.

### Typical relocation flow
- A call from one function to another is recorded with a relocation entry pointing to the target symbol
- During linking, once symbol addresses are known, the linker writes the correct value into the patched location (absolute or PC-relative, depending on the platform/relocation type)

### REL vs RELA (conceptual)
- `REL`: the addend is stored at the relocation target location
- `RELA`: the addend is stored in the relocation entry itself

You generally don’t need to choose; your toolchain emits what your platform uses.

---

## 7. Putting it all together (mental model)

1) Compile each source file → `.o` (ELF relocatable object with sections, symbols, relocations)  
2) Optionally pack related `.o` into `.a` (static library with a symbol index)  
3) Link objects and libraries → final executable/shared object (symbols resolved, relocations applied)

This modular flow enables fast builds, code reuse, and clean separation of concerns.

---

## 8. Useful inspection commands (optional)

- Show symbols: `nm file.o` (look for T/t for text, U for undefined)
- Show sections: `readelf -S file.o`
- Show relocations: `readelf -r file.o`
- Inspect library members: `ar t libsomething.a`

## 9. Troubleshooting quick reference

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| `undefined reference to 'foo'` | Missing definition or library order | Place library after objects; ensure symbol exists |
| `cannot find -l<name>` | Library not found in search paths | Add `-L<dir>` or correct library name |
| Multiple definition of `foo` | Same strong symbol defined twice | Keep a single definition or use internal (static) linkage |
| Wrong or stale behavior | Old objects/libraries used | Clean and rebuild (`rm *.o *.a`), then link again |

This guide intentionally focuses on essentials: what `.o` and `.a` are, how they fit with ELF, and how linkers resolve symbols and apply relocations. The sections are designed to read as one cohesive story from compile to link.
